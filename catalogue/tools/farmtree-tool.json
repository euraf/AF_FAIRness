  "description": "The FarmTree Tool is an Agroforestry System Simulation Tool originally meant to capture farmers' decennia-long experiences in a hands-on decision support tool (2010s). In the 2020s it developed into an online quantitative development tool. It has (early 2024) the following modules:\n(1) Components of Agroforestry Systems (CAFS) database. This database holds tree species in a functional hierarchy (e.g., fruit tree > tropical > mango > hapus). This database will be online in spring 2024; in the meanwhile FarmTree operates its internal database.\n(2) FarmTree Model. This simulation model (with global application) is built up of (a) an annual and perennial growth model (b) an interaction-between-CAFS model  (competition for space, water, nutrients) (c) a soil fertility and hydrology model (d) APIs to Climate Change and Soil databases that make projections location-specific all over the globe.\n(3) FarmTree Model Interface. This is the interface through which users can run scenarios, compare projections, download outcomes. Functionality is continuously developing. Sub-tools are (a) Carbon Projection Tool, that projects the carbon performance of Agroforestry systems (b) Hydrology Projection Tool, that projects the hydrology of different Plot Scenarios (c) Economic Projection Tool, that projects the economic performance of different Plot Scenarios (d) Comparison Tool, that shows the performance of different scenarios side-by -side. Ask for a demo if you want to see it all.\n(4)  In early 2024, the FarmTree Model will be approachable through an API. Ask the FarmTree Team for details.",
